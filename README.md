# Social-Network-API

<a name="descsection"></a>
## Description
The purpose of this project was to utilize mongoDB, mongoose, and Express.js to create a social network where the user can add/remove friends, thoughts, and reactions.  Using insomnia, you are able to fetch information from the mongo database.  In addition, moment.js was used in order to format the date in a more human-friendly manner. Enjoy!
